                    <p>SAGrader is a modern Perl web application backed by MySQL and Redis. It is a fully featured learning management system used by 4,000 students a year.</p>
                    <p>Instructors can collaborate with our content developers to create their own custom writing assignments from short answer to full length essays. Students submit to these assignments and receive instant, automated, content-based feedback tailored to their response. Students are encouraged to revise to fully master the topic.</p>
                    <p>SAGrader's core technology uses natural language processing to do qualitative text analysis of our student's writing. This allows SAGrader to give very detailed, specific feedback instantly to students.</p>
                    <p>Some of the features I've worked on are described below.</p>
